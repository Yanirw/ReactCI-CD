## Continuous Integration and Deployment


This project uses Travis CI to automatically build, test, and deploy changes in a simple react web application to AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

Whenever changes are pushed to the main branch, Travis CI runs the build and test scripts and, if successful, deploys the updated app to Elastic Beanstalk.

This allows for rapid and reliable deployment of changes to the application.
